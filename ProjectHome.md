# Ingrid #
Data Grids don't have to be difficult to use anymore - say hi to Ingrid.
Ingrid is an unobtrusive jQuery component that adds Data Grid behaviors (ajax, column resizing, paging, sorting, row and column styling, persistent state, and more) to your tables.

It's light (16 KB minified), easy to get started, and highly customizable!

The full package includes everything you need to start using ingrid.

Source and samples can be found on SVN.
